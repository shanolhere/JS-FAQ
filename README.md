# JS FAQ/ Accordion app

## What is a FAQ/ Accordion ?

  Acccordion / FAQ is nothing but a QnA section which we will came across in websites. These will provide a better understanding of the concepts like for instance, the frequently asked questions about a course, site, mission etc.

Here, in this project we will be creating an accordion with the help of,
  
     faq.style.display = "block";
     faq.style.display = 'none';

For better understanding, do check the sourcecode.
